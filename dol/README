
Nintendo GameCube DOL Loader Plugin v0.1
----------------------------------------

This is a very simple plugin to load DOL files into IDA for reverse 
engineering purposes. 
              (You need of course PPC support in your version of IDA)

To compile this loader module unpack the loader plugin source to
a folder on your harddisk, open the VC++ 6.0 project file and
adjust the include and library paths to match your installation
of the IDA SDK.

Don't forget to compile as release version. If you compile as
debug version you will most probably get an error about an undefined
__NT__ symbol.

You may direct any question concerning the module to me.
